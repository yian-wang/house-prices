# Predicting House Prices
A project adapted from a Data Analysis course at the University of Toronto (STA302/1001)
#### Project Status: Completed 

## Project Information
The purpose of this project is to use simple linear regression (SLR) to build a machine learning model to predict sale prices for houses in two neighbourhoods based on their listing prices. See [HousingMarketProject.ipynb](https://github.com/yian-wang/housing-proj/blob/master/HousingMarketProject.ipynb) to view process.

### Methods Used
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Simple Linear Regression
* Model Training (training/test sets)

### Technologies
* Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib)
* Jupyter

## Data Source
The data was provided through the course assignment in STA303/1001 at University of Toronto
